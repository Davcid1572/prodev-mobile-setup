## 🔄 Project Reset Documentation

### 📌 Command Executed

```bash
npm run reset-project

### 🎯 Purpose of the Reset

-- The reset script was used to restore the Expo project to a clean default state while preserving existing project files.
This is useful when starting fresh or fixing structural issues without losing previous work.

### 🗂️ What Happened During the Reset

When the reset command was executed, the system prompted whether to move existing files instead of deleting them.
```

### ✅ Outcome

Existing project files were safely preserved in /app-example

A fresh, clean Expo app structure was successfully generated

The project is now ready for a clean restart or restructuring
