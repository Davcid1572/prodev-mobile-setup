# 🚀 Expo Go Setup Documentation

> **Project Goal:** Set up Expo Go on a physical device to enable smooth React Native mobile development without heavy emulators.

---

## 📌 Overview

Mobile development often requires more computational resources than web development due to emulators and platform-specific tooling. To simplify this process, this project uses the **Expo Framework for React Native**.

**Expo Go** allows you to run and test React Native applications directly on your physical device, making development faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and ready:

- ✅ **Node.js (LTS version)**
- ✅ **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – recommended IDE
- ✅ **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- ✅ **Physical Mobile Device** (Android or iOS)

---

## ❓ Why Expo Go?

Traditional mobile development relies on emulators that must constantly be updated to match new devices (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max or multiple Android models). These emulators are often resource-intensive.

### ✨ Benefits of Expo Go

- 📱 Test apps directly on real devices
- 🔄 Live reload for instant feedback
- 💸 No need for expensive hardware
- ⚡ Faster development and debugging
- 🌍 Works on both Android and iOS
